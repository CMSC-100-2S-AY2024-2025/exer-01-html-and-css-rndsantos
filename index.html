          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I am Roberto Neil Santos, but you can call me Robbie. I was born and
            raised in Pasig City but later on, my family moved to Angono, Rizal.
            I went to Rizal National Science High School. My favorite subject
            was Math (yes, it is Math) and I've always enjoyed how my favorite
            teacher, Ma'am Ulang, teaches. That's about it in high school.
            <br /><br />
            It may have been obvious at this point but one of my hobbies is
            coding. I first started coding when I was 12. I remember watching
            "Big Hero 6" and I was just astonished with the robots that made me
            curious enough to dive in to the field of technology. Long story
            short, I studied and studied and got me to where I am today.
